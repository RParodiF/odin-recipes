      <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A cheesecake is a creamy, rich dessert that is typically made with a crust made of graham crackers or cookies, and filling made of cream cheese, eggs and sugar. It is often topped with fruit, chocolate, or caramel sauce. The texture of a cheesecake is smooth and velvety, and it has a slightly tangy flavor due to the cream cheese.</p>
        <p>Cheesecakes can be baked or made with a no-bake filling that is chilled until set. They are often served chilled, and can be sliced and served as a pie or cut into individual servings.</p>
        <p>This desert is popular for special occasions, and there are many variations, including flavors such as chocolate, pumpkin and lemon.</p>
